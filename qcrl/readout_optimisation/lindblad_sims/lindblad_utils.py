# Important Steps

# Convert Ket to DM

# Have a Hamiltonian with Time Dependence, for eg.
# H = -0.5 * chi * cd*c +- chi * qd*q*cd*c - 0.5*K*cd^2*c^2 + A(t)*cd + A^*(t)*c

# To handle some terms having a function and some not, multiply all terms either by a constant
# function or a time dependent function
