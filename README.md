# qcrl

To use the incredibly useful Hamiltonian Evaluator Technology, git clone the repo, install sympy and numpy (or the requirements from the requirements.txt file), and run the example.py file under the folder qcrl/symbolic. Some more speedups to the Hamiltonian Technology, and added features are on the way!

Instructions:
1. Make a virtual environment
2. git clone this repo: git clone https://github.com/AnikenC/qcrl
3. Install sympy and numpy: pip3 install sympy numpy
4. Or install all the dependencies I'm using for my project with: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
5. Checkout qcrl/symbolic/example.py for a tutorial, and run it from the command line with: python3 qcrl/symbolic/example.py
6. Hope you enjoy the Next-Generation Quantum Hamiltonian Expression Evaluator Technology!
